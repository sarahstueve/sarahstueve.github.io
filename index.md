## Hello this is Sarah's webpage!
### I plan on adding more content here eventually, but for now, hi LING 539. Here is my technical tutorial for Stanza.

# Classifying Propaganda with Stanza and gensim Doc2Vec
### Sarah Stueve

Before we get started, make sure you have the correct packages installed. I tried to create a Docker container that runs Anaconda Python, but I was unable to completely do this correctly. The image is tagged at sarahstueve/stanza_tutorial.

The required dependencies I am using for this tutorial are as follows:
* Anaconda Python, or at least packages: pickle, pandas, sklearn, numpy
* Stanza which can be downloaded [here](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/installation_usage.html![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34466941/117510043-31034e00-af40-11eb-9d85-c06f2135a54b.png)
* gensim which can be installed using ``pip install gensim``
